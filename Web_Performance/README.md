# WEB Performance
## Critical rendering path:
* Optimizing for performance is all about understanding what happens in these intermediate steps between receiving the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bytes and the required processing to turn them into rendered pixels **that's the critical rendering path.**
## Service Workers:
* A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. 
* The core feature is the ability to intercept and handle network requests.
* The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience.
* It's a JavaScript Worker, so it can't access the DOM directly.
* Service workers make extensive use of promises, so you should know JavaScript promises
