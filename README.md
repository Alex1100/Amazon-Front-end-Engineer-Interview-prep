# Front-end Engineer Tips
* Familiarity with prominent programming languages, including the syntax of the language. Pick the one you'r most comfortable with and stick with it.
* Know how to use languages, libraries, and rendering technologies (e.g., web: JavaScript,templating languages,HTML, CSS; C#, webviews, view frameworks).
* Showcase your knowledge of front-end system design. i.e. reusable components,separation of concerns (view models from business logic), application state management, and basic n-tier computing concepts (front-end, middle-tier, back-end).
* Understand the inner workings of common data structures. Be able to compare and contrast their usage in various applications (e.g., retrieving JSON and using it to populate and power a user interface).
* Research application performance concepts and technology. i.e resource caching (images, fonts),content delivery,asynchronous programming, and real usermetrics.
* Write syntactically correct codeâ€”no pseudo code. Ensure it is scalable, robust,and well-tested.
* Use object-oriented design or functional programming (logical and maintainable code) best practices to build lasting, scalable software.
* Familiarity with the devices and/or browsers which run your software. Topics such as system availability, efficient resource usage (CPU, battery, screen size),and performance implications.
* Familiarity with device and/or browser topics such as security, native API methods, local storage, and compatibility.
