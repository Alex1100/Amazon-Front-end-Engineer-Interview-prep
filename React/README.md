# What Is React?
* React is a JavaScript Library.
* React is not a framework
* React is an open-source project created by Facebook.
* React is used to user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
* React is the view layer of an MVC application (model view controller)
  ** MVC(MODEL, VIEW, CONTROLLER) _The big idea behind MVC is that each section of your code has a purpose, and those purposes are different. Some of your code holds the data of your app, some of your code makes your app look nice, and some of your code controls how your app functions._
  * Model: _Model code typically reflects real-world things. This code can hold raw data, or it will define the essential components of your app. For instance, if you were building a To-do app, the model code would define what a “task” is and what a “list” is – since those are the main components of a todo app._
  * View: _View code is made up of all the functions that directly interact with the user. This is the code that makes your app look nice, and otherwise defines how your user sees and interacts with it._
  * Controller: _Controller code acts as a liaison between the Model and the View, receiving user input and deciding what to do with it. It’s the brains of the application, and ties together the model and the view._
